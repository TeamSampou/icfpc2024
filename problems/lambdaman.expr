EStr "Welcome to the Lambda-Man course.\n\nIt was the year 2014, and many members of our community worked hard to control Lambda-Man. Now, ten years later, this wonderful event is still memorized by holding a small Lambda-Man competition.\n\nThis course will teach you how to optimally control Lambda-Man to eat all pills. There is no fruit involved (neither low-hanging nor high-hanging), and even better: no ghosts! The input to each problem is a simple rectangular grid such as the following:\n\n```\n###.#...\n...L..##\n.#######\n```\n\nThe grid contains exactly one `L` character, which is the starting position of Lambda-Man. There will be one or more `.` characters indicating the locations of pills to be eaten, and `#` characters are walls. The outside boundary of the grid is considered to consist of walls as well.\n\nA solution should be a string of `U`, `R`, `D` and `L` characters (up, right, down, left, respectively) indicating the path to take. For example, a possible solution to the above example grid is the following path:\n```\nLLLDURRRUDRRURR\n```\nWhen Lambda-Man is instructed to move into a square containing a wall, nothing happens and the instruction is skipped. Your solution may consist of at most `1,000,000` characters.\n\nThe following levels are available:\n* [lambdaman1] Your score: 33. Best score: 33.\n* [lambdaman2] Your score: 44. Best score: 44.\n* [lambdaman3] Your score: 58. Best score: 58.\n* [lambdaman4] Your score: 412. Best score: 126.\n* [lambdaman5] Your score: 161. Best score: 130.\n* [lambdaman6] Your score: 135. Best score: 73.\n* [lambdaman7] Your score: 464. Best score: 125.\n* [lambdaman8] Your score: 4917. Best score: 113.\n* [lambdaman9] Your score: 2517. Best score: 110.\n* [lambdaman10] Your score: 2401. Best score: 127.\n* [lambdaman11] Your score: 10007. Best score: 170.\n* [lambdaman12] Your score: 10011. Best score: 165.\n* [lambdaman13] Your score: 9995. Best score: 165.\n* [lambdaman14] Your score: 10011. Best score: 165.\n* [lambdaman15] Your score: 9995. Best score: 161.\n* [lambdaman16] Your score: 8209. Best score: 184.\n* [lambdaman17] Your score: 2924. Best score: 127.\n* [lambdaman18] Your score: 14080. Best score: 191.\n* [lambdaman19] Your score: 16364. Best score: 273.\n* [lambdaman20] Your score: 21374. Best score: 201.\n* [lambdaman21] Your score: 34171. Best score: 190.\n\nTo submit a solution, send an ICFP expression that evaluates to:\n\n```\nsolve lambdamanX path\n```\n\nYour score is number of bytes that the ICFP expressions consists of (i.e. the size of the POST body), so a lower score is better.\n"
