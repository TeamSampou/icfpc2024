EStr "Welcome to the Spaceship course!\n\nIn 2020, most of us have learned how to operate a spaceship. In this course we'll play a small chess-like game featuring the spaceship! The game operates on an infinite 2D chess board, with the spaceship initially located on `(0,0)`. The spaceship has a velocity `vx` and `vy`, which are initially both set to `0`. In each turn the player can increase/decrease each of those numbers by at most one, and then the piece moves `vx` steps to the right and `vy` steps up.\n\nMoves are represented with a single digit, inspired by the old numeric pad on a computer keyboard that we used to have in the old days on Earth. For example, `7` means decreasing `vx` and increasing `vy` by `1`, while `6` means increasing `vx` by `1` and keeping `vy` the same. A path can then be represented by a sequence of digits, e.g. the path `236659` visits, in this order, the following squares: `(0,0) (0,-1) (1,-3) (3,-5) (6,-7) (9,-9) (13,-10)`.\n\nNow the challenge is the following: given a list of squares to be visited, find a sequence of moves that visits all those squares. Your solution may consist of at most `10,000,000` moves.\n\nThe following levels are available:\n* [spaceship1] Your score: 5. Best score: 5.\n* [spaceship2] Your score: 50. Best score: 49.\n* [spaceship3] Your score: 25. Best score: 10.\n* [spaceship4] Your score: 356. Best score: 99.\n* [spaceship5] Your score: 444. Best score: 116.\n* [spaceship6] Your score: 418. Best score: 117.\n* [spaceship7] Your score: 241. Best score: 94.\n* [spaceship8] Your score: 230. Best score: 90.\n* [spaceship9] Your score: 552. Best score: 206.\n* [spaceship10] Your score: 866. Best score: 304.\n* [spaceship11] Your score: 8192. Best score: 8192.\n* [spaceship12] Your score: 148833. Best score: 8192.\n* [spaceship13] Your score: 127292. Best score: 23791.\n* [spaceship14] Your score: 1059. Best score: 137.\n* [spaceship15] Your score: 81. Best score: 39.\n* [spaceship16] Your score: 3133. Best score: 1373.\n* [spaceship17] Your score: 972. Best score: 415.\n* [spaceship18] Your score: 4279. Best score: 1839.\n* [spaceship19] Your score: 213010. Best score: 11328.\n* [spaceship20] Your score: 6268. Best score: 2351.\n* [spaceship21] Your score: 6281. Best score: 2412.\n* [spaceship22] Your score: 2624. Best score: 1168.\n* [spaceship23] Best score: 168502.\n* [spaceship24] Best score: 564874.\n* [spaceship25] Best score: 609455.\n\nTo submit a solution, send an ICFP expression that evaluates to:\n\n```\nsolve spaceshipX moves\n```\n\nYour score is the number of moves, so a lower score is better.\n"
